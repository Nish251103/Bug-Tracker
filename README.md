# Bug-Tracker
Inspiration
While working on a project people often find it hard to keep track of bugs and errors. That's when we came up with the idea of The Bug Tracker.

What it does
A bug tracker ensures bugs are easily detected and fixed. It helps get rid of issues in the software by regulating the work of each team member, which is crucial if you're running large projects.

How we built it
We used HTML, CSS and JS for front-end development and Flask which is one of the most popular python framework was used for back-end. We used sawolab's API to secure our web app.

Challenges we ran into
As it was a team project, it was hard to communicate on an online platform.

What we learned
We learned how to work better in a team environment. Our command over web development became smoother. We learned how to utilize sawolabs and filebase in our project. We also interacted with Github.
